# Architecture

GitGandalf is a Bun-native webhook service built in phases. The current repository includes the complete webhook-to-review-to-publish path: webhook ingestion, typed GitLab access, repo cache management, modular tool execution, the multi-agent review subsystem, GitLab publishing, deployment packaging, and structured logging with request correlation.

For the concise agent-optimized version, see [`docs/agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Implemented Components

### Hono server

- `src/index.ts` creates the app, calls `initLogging()`, enables structured HTTP request logging via `@logtape/hono` middleware (JSON Lines, health check excluded), mounts `/api/v1`, and exports Bun server config.
- `GET /api/v1/health` returns `{ status: "ok", timestamp }`.

### Structured logging

`src/logger.ts` is the single logging configuration module.

- **Library**: LogTape (`@logtape/logtape` + `@logtape/hono`) — zero dependencies, Bun-native Web APIs, first-party Hono middleware.
- **Output**: JSON Lines to stdout via `getConsoleSink({ formatter: jsonLinesFormatter })`. When `LOG_LEVEL=debug` outside tests, the same records are also appended to `logs/gg-dev.log` in the project root.
- **Level control**: `config.LOG_LEVEL` maps to LogTape's `lowestLevel` on the root `["gandalf"]` category. All child categories (`["gandalf", "router"]`, `["gandalf", "orchestrator"]`, etc.) inherit it automatically.
- **Request correlation**: `requestId` is generated in the router via `Bun.randomUUIDv7()`. Both the router and pipeline call `withContext()` to set `requestId`, `projectId`, and `mrIid` as implicit context via `AsyncLocalStorage`. Every log line emitted anywhere in the pipeline carries these fields without explicit passing.
- **Future sinks**: Adding `@logtape/otel` or `@logtape/sentry` only requires adding a new sink to `initLogging()` — no call-site changes.

### Webhook router

`src/api/router.ts` does four real jobs today:

1. verifies the GitLab shared secret
2. validates webhook payloads with Zod schemas that require the fields GitGandalf uses while tolerating additional GitLab webhook keys
3. filters down to merge-request review triggers
4. hands the event to `runPipeline(event)` without blocking the HTTP response

The filter rules are intentionally narrow:

- merge request actions: `open`, `update`, `reopen`
- note trigger: `/ai-review` comment on a merge request

### Zod schema boundary

`src/api/schemas.ts` defines permissive object schemas for:

- project identity
- user identity
- merge request attributes
- note attributes
- a discriminated union over `object_kind`

This means required fields are validated, while extra GitLab keys are tolerated. That matches real GitLab webhook payloads better than the earlier strict-only version.

### GitLab client wrapper

`src/gitlab-client/client.ts` wraps `@gitbeaker/rest` behind a smaller domain API:

- `getMRDetails()`
- `getMRDiff()`
- `getMRDiscussions()`
- `createMRNote()`
- `createInlineDiscussion()`

The wrapper also handles gitbeaker's awkward snake_case response shapes and camelCase create-option shapes in one place. MR diffs are fetched via `MergeRequests.allDiffs()`.

### Repo cache manager

`src/context/repo-manager.ts` is the repo access layer used by the current review pipeline.

- repo cache path: `<REPO_CACHE_DIR>/<projectId>`
- first-time path: `git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch>`
- refresh path: `git fetch origin <branch> --depth 1` + `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`
- cleanup: TTL-based eviction using directory `mtime`

Security detail: the clone URL hostname must match `GITLAB_URL`. The manager refuses to inject the GitLab token into a different host, which blocks token exfiltration through a malicious webhook payload.

### Modular tool system

Phase 2.5 split the original monolithic `src/context/tools.ts` into per-tool modules under `src/context/tools/`.

- `read-file.ts`
- `search-codebase.ts`
- `get-directory-structure.ts`
- `shared.ts`
- `index.ts`

This keeps each tool independently testable and makes the public API surface explicit in one place.

The public contract is now fully internal to GitGandalf:

- each tool module exports `toolDefinition`, `inputSchema`, and its implementation
- `src/context/tools/index.ts` assembles `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` using the internal `AgentToolDefinition` type
- provider SDK tool types do not leak into the repo-facing tool layer

### Agent review subsystem

Phase 3 adds the review logic itself under `src/agents/`.

- `state.ts` defines `Finding` and `ReviewState`
- `protocol.ts` defines the app-owned agent message and tool contract
- `llm-client.ts` adapts AWS Bedrock Runtime Converse to that internal contract
- `context-agent.ts` derives MR intent, changed areas, and initial risk hypotheses
- `investigator-agent.ts` runs the tool loop against the cloned repository context
- `reflection-agent.ts` filters noise and assigns the review verdict
- `orchestrator.ts` coordinates the three stages and allows one reinvestigation loop

This review subsystem is implemented, tested, and wired into the full API pipeline.

Important runtime detail: if Agent 2 calls a tool incorrectly or asks for a missing file, the tool error is converted into an error `tool_result` block and sent back to the model. The review continues instead of aborting the entire pipeline.

Another current behavior worth knowing: only findings that can be anchored to the MR diff are published inline. Findings outside the diff are skipped for inline publication and summarized instead.

## What Is Still Planned

The target architecture in the master plan goes further than the current implementation.

### Phase 5+

- task queue and worker split
- Kubernetes deployment shape
- provider fallback and LLM abstraction hardening

## Why the Design Looks This Way

- Bun is used directly for runtime, subprocesses, and file access to keep the stack small and fast.
- Zod is used at all external boundaries so invalid inputs fail before they enter core logic.
- The repo owns its own agent protocol so provider SDKs stay replaceable.
- The tool system is split by file so future tools are modular and reusable.
- The agent subsystem remains independently testable even though it is now wired into the full API pipeline.

## ELI5

GitGandalf receives a GitLab webhook, validates the important parts, fetches the MR and repo contents, lets three agents investigate the change, and posts the result back to GitLab. The code keeps Bedrock-specific details boxed into one adapter, and every log line carries the same request context so humans and agents can trace a review end to end.
