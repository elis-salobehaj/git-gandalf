# Architecture

GitGandalf is a Bun-native webhook service that is being built in phases. As of Phase 3, the repository contains a complete webhook ingestion layer, a typed GitLab client, a repo cache manager, a modular tool execution surface, and a standalone multi-agent review subsystem. The remaining gap is wiring that review subsystem into the API pipeline and publishing results back to GitLab.

For the concise agent-optimized version, see [`docs/agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Phase Ownership

| Area | Current Status | Owning Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| `src/gitlab-client/` | Implemented | Phase 1 | Typed GitLab wrapper exists, including read and write methods needed by later phases. |
| `src/context/repo-manager.ts` | Implemented | Phase 2 | Shallow clone/update cache manager with TTL cleanup and host validation. |
| `src/context/tools/` | Implemented | Phase 2 and 2.5 | Tool surface exists and was modularized in Phase 2.5 into one file per tool. |
| `src/agents/` | Implemented | Phase 3 | Shared state, Bedrock client wrapper, context agent, investigator agent, reflection agent, and orchestrator are implemented as a standalone subsystem. |
| `src/publisher/` | Planned | Phase 4 | GitLab publisher for inline comments and summary comment is not implemented yet. |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, top-level `README.md` | Planned | Phase 4 | Deployment packaging and end-user project documentation remain open. |
| `tests/webhook.test.ts` | Implemented | Phase 1 | Covers auth, filtering, invalid payloads, and strict schema behavior. |
| `tests/tools.test.ts`, `tests/repo-manager.test.ts` | Implemented | Phase 2 and 2.5 | Covers tool sandboxing, search and tree behavior, repo cache cleanup, and SSRF guard behavior. |

## Implemented Components

### Hono server

- `src/index.ts` creates the app, enables request logging, mounts `/api/v1`, and exports Bun server config.
- `GET /api/v1/health` returns `{ status: "ok", timestamp }`.

### Webhook router

`src/api/router.ts` does four real jobs today:

1. verifies the GitLab shared secret
2. validates webhook payloads with strict Zod schemas
3. filters down to merge-request review triggers
4. hands the event to `runPipeline(event)` without blocking the HTTP response

The filter rules are intentionally narrow:

- merge request actions: `open`, `update`, `reopen`
- note trigger: `/ai-review` comment on a merge request

### Zod schema boundary

`src/api/schemas.ts` defines strict object schemas for:

- project identity
- user identity
- merge request attributes
- note attributes
- a discriminated union over `object_kind`

This means extra top-level keys are rejected rather than tolerated silently.

### GitLab client wrapper

`src/gitlab-client/client.ts` wraps `@gitbeaker/rest` behind a smaller domain API:

- `getMRDetails()`
- `getMRDiff()`
- `getMRDiscussions()`
- `createMRNote()`
- `createInlineDiscussion()`

The wrapper also handles gitbeaker’s awkward snake_case response shapes and camelCase create-option shapes in one place.

### Repo cache manager

`src/context/repo-manager.ts` is the first piece of the future context engine.

- repo cache path: `<REPO_CACHE_DIR>/<projectId>`
- first-time path: `git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch>`
- refresh path: `git fetch origin <branch> --depth 1` + `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`
- cleanup: TTL-based eviction using directory `mtime`

Security detail: the clone URL hostname must match `GITLAB_URL`. The manager refuses to inject the GitLab token into a different host, which blocks token exfiltration through a malicious webhook payload.

### Modular tool system

Phase 2.5 split the original monolithic `src/context/tools.ts` into per-tool modules under `src/context/tools/`.

- `read-file.ts`
- `search-codebase.ts`
- `get-directory-structure.ts`
- `shared.ts`
- `index.ts`

This keeps each tool independently testable and makes the public API surface explicit in one place.

### Standalone agent review subsystem

Phase 3 adds the review logic itself under `src/agents/`.

- `state.ts` defines `Finding` and `ReviewState`
- `llm-client.ts` wraps the Anthropic Bedrock messages API
- `context-agent.ts` derives MR intent, changed areas, and initial risk hypotheses
- `investigator-agent.ts` runs the tool loop against the cloned repository context
- `reflection-agent.ts` filters noise and assigns the review verdict
- `orchestrator.ts` coordinates the three stages and allows one reinvestigation loop

This review subsystem is implemented and testable on its own, but it is not yet wired to fetch GitLab data automatically or publish comments.

## What Is Still Planned

The target architecture in the master plan goes further than the current implementation.

### Phase 4

- publisher that turns verified findings into MR comments
- full pipeline wiring from webhook → clone → review → publish
- Docker packaging and top-level README

## Why the Design Looks This Way

- Bun is used directly for runtime, subprocesses, and file access to keep the stack small and fast.
- Zod is used at all external boundaries so invalid inputs fail before they enter core logic.
- The tool system is split by file so future tools are modular and reusable.
- The agent subsystem is implemented before the full API wiring so the review engine can be tested independently.

## ELI5

Right now GitGandalf can answer the phone, check who is calling, decide whether the call matters, and it also already has a review brain that can inspect a merge request if you hand it the MR details, diff, and repo path. What it does not do yet is connect those two halves automatically or post comments back to GitLab.
