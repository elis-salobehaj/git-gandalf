# Architecture (Agent Reference)

Concise reference for the architecture implemented in the current repo.

## Runtime Surface

- `src/index.ts`: Bun entrypoint. Initializes LogTape, mounts `/api/v1`, applies `@logtape/hono` request logging, exports the Bun server.
- `src/logger.ts`: central logging config. Wires `LOG_LEVEL`, emits JSON Lines, appends debug runs to `logs/gg-dev.log`, and propagates implicit context with `AsyncLocalStorage`.
- `src/config.ts`: Zod-validated config singleton parsed from `process.env`.
- `src/api/router.ts`: verifies `X-Gitlab-Token`, validates webhook payloads, filters supported events, generates `requestId`, and starts the async pipeline.
- `src/api/schemas.ts`: permissive Zod schemas for `merge_request` and `note` webhooks. Required fields are enforced; extra GitLab keys are tolerated.
- `src/api/pipeline.ts`: fetches MR metadata and diffs, clones or updates the repo cache, runs the review pipeline, and publishes results back to GitLab.
- `src/gitlab-client/client.ts`: typed wrapper over `@gitbeaker/rest` for MR details, diffs, discussions, summary notes, and inline discussions.
- `src/context/repo-manager.ts`: shallow clone/update cache manager using native `git` through `Bun.spawn()`.
- `src/context/tools/`: modular tool implementations and the public tool manifest consumed by Agent 2.
- `src/agents/protocol.ts`: app-owned message, tool-call, tool-result, stop-reason, and tool-definition contract.
- `src/agents/llm-client.ts`: adapter between the internal protocol and AWS Bedrock Runtime Converse.
- `src/agents/`: context agent, investigator loop, reflection agent, and the orchestrator.
- `src/publisher/gitlab-publisher.ts`: publishes verified findings as inline discussions when possible and always posts a summary note.

## Webhook Flow

1. GitLab sends `merge_request` or `note` webhook to `POST /api/v1/webhooks/gitlab`.
2. Router checks `X-Gitlab-Token` against `config.GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. Router parses JSON and validates `webhookPayloadSchema` with `safeParse()`.
4. Router accepts only:
	- merge requests with action `open`, `update`, or `reopen`
	- note events on `MergeRequest` whose text begins with `/ai-review`
5. Router generates `requestId` via `Bun.randomUUIDv7()`.
6. Router calls `runPipeline(event)` inside `withContext({ requestId })` without awaiting it.
7. HTTP response returns immediately:
	- `202 Accepted` for supported review triggers
	- `200 Ignored` for valid but unsupported events
	- `400` for invalid JSON or invalid payloads
	- `401` for bad secret

## Request Correlation

- Router sets `requestId`.
- Pipeline adds `projectId` and `mrIid`.
- LogTape implicit context carries those fields across the full async path: router -> pipeline -> orchestrator -> publisher.

## Repo And Tool Layer

### Repo manager

- cache key: `<REPO_CACHE_DIR>/<projectId>`
- clone path: `git clone --depth 1 --branch <branch>`
- refresh path: `git fetch origin <branch> --depth 1` then `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`
- cleanup: TTL eviction using directory `mtime`
- host guard: clone URL hostname must match `config.GITLAB_URL`

### Tool surface

- `read_file`: reads a sandboxed file and prefixes 1-based line numbers
- `search_codebase`: shells out to `rg --json`, parses NDJSON, caps results at `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS`
- `get_directory_structure`: directory tree up to depth 3 with common heavy directories ignored
- `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`: internal tool manifest exported from `src/context/tools/index.ts`
- `executeTool()`: validates tool inputs with Zod before dispatching

All tool file access is sandboxed with `path.resolve()` plus repo-root prefix checks.

## Review Pipeline

The pipeline is fully implemented and invoked from `src/api/pipeline.ts`.

1. `contextAgent()` derives MR intent, change categories, and risk areas.
2. `investigatorLoop()` calls Bedrock through `chatCompletion()`, executes tool calls, and accumulates raw findings.
3. `reflectionAgent()` filters unsupported or weak findings and assigns the verdict.
4. `orchestrator.ts` allows one reinvestigation pass when reflection requests it.

### Internal protocol boundary

- All agent state uses `src/agents/protocol.ts`, not provider SDK types.
- `src/agents/llm-client.ts` is the only Bedrock-specific message translation layer.
- Tool definitions are also internalized, so the investigator loop does not depend on provider SDK tool schemas.

### Tool-failure behavior

- Individual tool failures do not abort the whole review.
- `investigatorLoop()` catches tool execution errors and feeds them back to the model as error `tool_result` blocks.
- This lets Agent 2 recover from missing files or bad tool inputs instead of crashing the pipeline.

## Publishing Behavior

- Verified findings are published as inline discussions when they can be anchored to the MR diff.
- Findings that cannot be anchored are skipped for inline publication but still contribute to the summary verdict.
- A summary note is always posted with the final verdict.

## Planned Next Boundaries

- Phase 4.5: Jira ticket-context enrichment
- Phase 4.6: GitLab SaaS and self-hosted compatibility hardening
- Phase 5+: queueing, Kubernetes, provider fallback
