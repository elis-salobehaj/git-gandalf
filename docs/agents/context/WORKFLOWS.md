# Workflows (Agent Reference)

Operational reference for the workflows implemented today and the next planned handoff points.

## 1. Webhook Ingestion

Implemented in `src/api/router.ts`.

### Accepted events

- merge request events with action `open`, `update`, or `reopen`
- note events whose body starts with `/ai-review` and whose `noteable_type` is `MergeRequest`

### Request handling

1. verify `X-Gitlab-Token`
2. parse JSON body
3. `safeParse()` against `webhookPayloadSchema`
4. filter unsupported events
5. generate `requestId` via `Bun.randomUUIDv7()` and propagate via LogTape `withContext()`
6. call `runPipeline(event)` without awaiting
7. return `202 Accepted`

HTTP request/response logging is handled automatically by `@logtape/hono` middleware and emits structured JSON Lines to stdout. Health check requests are excluded from logging.

### Response codes

- `401 Unauthorized`: wrong or missing secret
- `400 Invalid JSON` / `400 Invalid payload`: malformed body or failed schema validation
- `200 Ignored`: valid webhook that does not match the trigger rules
- `202 Accepted`: relevant webhook queued into the stub pipeline

## 2. Repo Cache Workflow

Implemented in `src/context/repo-manager.ts`.

- cache location: `config.REPO_CACHE_DIR/<projectId>`
- first fetch path: shallow clone
- refresh path: shallow fetch + hard reset to `origin/<branch>`
- cleanup path: delete cached directories older than TTL
- security gate: clone URL host must match `config.GITLAB_URL`

## 3. Tool Execution Workflow

Implemented in `src/context/tools/index.ts` and per-tool modules.

1. LLM emits `tool_use` block
2. `executeTool()` selects the tool by name
3. tool input is validated with a Zod schema
4. implementation runs inside the repo sandbox
5. result is returned as a string or JSON string payload

### Current tools

- `read_file`
- `search_codebase`
- `get_directory_structure`

## 4. Full Pipeline

`src/api/pipeline.ts` is the full end-to-end pipeline: fetch MR data → clone repo → run agents → publish findings.
All pipeline logs emit structured JSON under `["gandalf", "pipeline"]` and carry the implicit `requestId`, `projectId`, and `mrIid` context set by the router and pipeline entry.

## 5. Agent Review Workflow

Implemented in `src/agents/`.

1. caller provides `ReviewState` input fields: `mrDetails`, `diffFiles`, `repoPath`
2. `contextAgent()` derives `mrIntent`, `changeCategories`, and `riskAreas`
3. `investigatorLoop()` builds the investigation prompt and calls Bedrock
4. tool requests are executed through `executeTool()` using `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`
5. `reflectionAgent()` filters the raw findings and assigns a verdict
6. `orchestrator.ts` allows one reinvestigation round when `needsReinvestigation` is true

The agent subsystem is implemented and invoked from the API pipeline.

## 6. Logging & Observability

All structured logs are emitted as JSON Lines to stdout via LogTape:

- `["gandalf", "http"]` — HTTP request/response via `@logtape/hono` middleware
- `["gandalf", "router"]` — webhook auth and validation events
- `["gandalf", "pipeline"]` — pipeline start/complete
- `["gandalf", "orchestrator"]` — per-agent-stage progress
- `["gandalf", "publisher"]` — inline comment posting, duplicates, errors

All log lines in the webhook → pipeline flow carry `requestId`, `projectId`, and `mrIid` automatically via LogTape implicit context.
