### 1. Holistic Overview (Executive Summary)
Phase 3 is code-complete but not completion-complete. The agent subsystem exists and passes current compile/test gates, but the repository still documents Phase 3 as planned, the docs index was not updated to reflect the new status, and the Phase 3 tests do not yet exercise the real agent entrypoints with mocked LLM responses. There is also a smaller compliance gap where investigator-agent uses unchecked casts when moving external LLM/tool data into internal state.

### 2. Remediation Objective
Close the remaining completion gaps so Phase 3 satisfies the master plan and AGENTS.md completion gate across implementation depth, testing, documentation, and plan tracking.

### 3. Ordered Remediation Steps
- [x] **[agent] Refresh Phase 3 documentation status**: Update `docs/README.md`, `docs/agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/agents/context/WORKFLOWS.md`, `docs/agents/context/CONFIGURATION.md`, and `docs/humans/context/ARCHITECTURE.md` so they describe the implemented agent subsystem and mark Phase 3 complete where appropriate.
- [x] **[agent] Strengthen Phase 3 tests**: Extend Phase 3 coverage so the real `contextAgent`, `investigatorLoop`, and `reflectionAgent` entrypoints are exercised with mocked `chatCompletion()` responses, alongside the existing orchestrator coverage.
- [x] **[agent] Remove unchecked agent-boundary casts**: Replace investigator-agent casts on tool definitions, assistant content, and tool input with typed adapters and/or Zod validation so external model data crosses validated boundaries before entering `ReviewState`.
- [x] **[agent] Re-run validation gates**: Run `bun run typecheck`, `bunx biome ci .`, and `bun test` to verify the Phase 3 remediation closes the review findings cleanly.

### 4. Required Validations
- [x] `bun run typecheck`
- [x] `bunx biome ci .`
- [x] `bun test`
- [x] Manual sanity check that docs no longer describe Phase 3 as planned

### 5. Documentation and Plan Updates
- [x] Update `docs/README.md` Phase 3 status and current-state summary
- [x] Update `docs/agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md` to move agents from planned to implemented
- [x] Update `docs/agents/context/WORKFLOWS.md` to document the agent pipeline separately from the still-stubbed API pipeline
- [x] Update `docs/agents/context/CONFIGURATION.md` notes for Bedrock/model/tool-loop settings
- [x] Update `docs/humans/context/ARCHITECTURE.md` intro, phase ownership, and planned sections to reflect implemented agents/tests

### 6. Human Decisions Needed
- None. The review findings are implementation-depth and completion-hygiene gaps that can be remediated without changing the committed architecture or plan scope.
