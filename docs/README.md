# GitGandalf Documentation

## 🤖 Agent Documentation (`docs/agents/`)

Concise, token-optimized reference for LLM agents. Prefer these over human docs to minimize context window usage.

- [Architecture](./agents/context/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Current runtime surface, webhook flow, repo manager, tool system, internal protocol boundary, and implemented publishing behavior
- [Configuration](./agents/context/CONFIGURATION.md) — Environment variables, defaults, required fields, and test-env notes
- [Workflows](./agents/context/WORKFLOWS.md) — Implemented webhook flow, repo cache workflow, tool execution, full review workflow, and logging/observability behavior
- [Tech Stack Design](./agents/designs/tech-stack-evaluation.md) — Stack decisions and rationale summary

## 👥 Human Documentation (`docs/humans/`)

Detailed, visual documentation with Mermaid diagrams and full rationale.

- [Architecture](./humans/context/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Current implemented architecture, internal protocol boundary, operational behavior, planned phases, and ELI5 explanation
- [Multi-Agent Architecture](./humans/designs/multi-agent-architecture.md) — Agent pipeline diagram, per-agent inputs/outputs, data flow, known issues (duplicate findings, overlapping line ranges), and proposed improvements
- [Tech Stack Design](./humans/designs/tech-stack-evaluation.md) — Complete ecosystem analysis and technology decisions

## 📚 Guides (`docs/guides/`)

- [Getting Started](./guides/GETTING_STARTED.md) — Local setup, env configuration, GitLab token/webhook secret creation, webhook reachability, Jira prep, health check, and sample webhook flow
- [Development](./guides/DEVELOPMENT.md) — Bun commands, testing strategy, logging conventions, plan-driven workflow, and tool-module conventions

## 📋 Implementation Plans (`docs/plans/`)

- **Active**: [GitGandalf Master Plan](./plans/active/git-gandalf-master-plan.md) — Phases 1–4 complete, with internal agent protocol now implemented and Phase 4.5 Jira integration / Phase 4.6 GitLab compatibility planned next
- **Active**: [Gandalf Awakening Personality Plan](./plans/active/Gandalf-awakening-personality-plan.md) — Trigger alias expansion, Gandalf-mode acknowledgements, and tone-aware top-level summary behavior
- **Implemented**: [Structured Logging](./plans/implemented/structured-logging-plan.md) — LogTape structured logging, request correlation, and docs overhaul across 5 phases
- **Implemented**: [Agentic Development Plan](./plans/implemented/agentic-development-plan.md) — Repo bootstrap and dev tooling setup

### Implementation Status

| Phase | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | ✅ Complete | Hono server, Zod webhook parsing, GitLab client wrapper, health and webhook endpoints |
| **Phase 2** | ✅ Complete | Repo cache manager, tool executor, file/search/directory tools, and test coverage foundation |
| **Phase 2.5** | ✅ Complete | Tool-per-file modularization with stable barrel import path in `src/context/tools/` |
| **Phase 3** | ✅ Complete | Shared review state, internal protocol, Bedrock Runtime adapter, context/investigator/reflection agents, orchestrator, and Phase 3 test coverage |
| **Phase 4** | ✅ Complete | GitLab publisher (inline comments, summary note, duplicate guard), full pipeline wiring, Dockerfile, Docker Compose, README |
| **Phase 4.5** | ⬜ Planned | Jira ticket-context fetch, pipeline enrichment, agent prompt updates, and setup documentation |
| **Phase 4.6** | ⬜ Planned | GitLab.com plus self-hosted compatibility, explicit deployment flag, and auth/host validation updates |
| **Logging** | ✅ Complete | LogTape structured logging, `LOG_LEVEL` wired, `@logtape/hono` middleware, request correlation via `withContext()`, debug log file at `logs/gg-dev.log` |
| **Phase 5** | ⬜ Planned | Hardening, BullMQ queue, Kubernetes |

## Current State Summary

Implemented today:

- webhook ingestion and filtering
- required-field Zod payload validation with permissive GitLab key handling
- GitLab data access wrapper
- repo cache manager with host validation
- modular tool surface for investigator agents
- internal agent and tool protocol owned by GitGandalf
- integrated multi-agent review pipeline with context, investigator, reflection, and orchestration stages
- end-to-end pipeline: webhook → agents → GitLab inline comments + summary note
- GitLab publisher with duplicate detection
- Dockerfile and Docker Compose for self-hosted deployment
- structured logging via LogTape (JSON Lines, `LOG_LEVEL` filtering, request correlation, debug file output)

Planned next:

- Phase 4.5 Jira ticket context integration
- Phase 4.6 GitLab.com and self-hosted compatibility
- Gandalf trigger and personality awakening for note-triggered reviews
- Phase 5 production hardening (task queue, Kubernetes)
